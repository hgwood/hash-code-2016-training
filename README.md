## REX

### Things to improve

- init repo in advance
  - collaborators
  - package.json
  - reading input files, writing output files (skeletons)
  - testing harness + test file skeleton
  - zip build
  - utility functions to iterate on grids
- do not change interfaces after they've been specified, prefer wrapping in adapter functions
- code read input and write ouput in parallel (don't assign the same person to both)
- work in pairs
- don't forget pen and paper

### Things to keep

- small independent files
- tests
